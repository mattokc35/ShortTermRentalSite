They were very responsive, the dart board was damage and they immediately replaced it. They took care of everything for us. Perfect for our family, the kids had so much fun. It felt like going to our vacation home, thatâ€™s how great the reception was and how everything was there for us. We will 100% consider to book again. Highly recommend.",
